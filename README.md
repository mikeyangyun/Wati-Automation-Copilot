# Wati Automation Builder Copilot

> AI-assisted design and pre-launch validation for Wati chatbot automations.

---

## Status

**Scaffold in place.** Monorepo, dev tooling, and a runnable Fastify + Vite skeleton are wired up. Agents, executor, and validator implementations are pending.

For the product specification, see [PRODUCT.md](./PRODUCT.md).

---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- Node `>=20` (project pins Node 22 LTS via `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm `>=9` (project pins `pnpm@11.1.2` via `packageManager`)

**Install and run**

```bash
nvm use                                                # reads .nvmrc
pnpm install
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env   # fill LLM_API_KEY when agents land
pnpm dev                                               # server on :3000, web on :5173
```

**Verify the skeleton**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# -> { "status": "ok", "uptime": ..., "timestamp": "..." }
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173> — the three-panel placeholder UI should load.

## Overview

**Wati Automation Builder Copilot** lets operators describe a chatbot automation in plain English and turns it into a Wati-compatible flow. The system explains the resulting logic, reviews it for defects and gaps, and runs a deterministic mock conversation so the design can be walked through before any flow is published.

The Copilot sits **upstream of publish** — design and validate first, then configure the approved flow in the Wati Builder.

**Primary users:** customer operations and CS leads, plus small business owners configuring routing and FAQ bots.

## Scope

| In scope (MVP)                                     | Out of scope (MVP)                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Natural-language input with starter examples       | Drag-and-drop visual editor         |
| Generation of a Wati-style flow from a brief       | Publish or deploy to live channels  |
| Read-only node graph + structured flow view        | Wati API / WhatsApp integration     |
| AI: generate, explain, review                      | Accounts, login, saved workflows    |
| Multi-turn mock simulation with fallback and reset | Persistent storage and flow library |
| Hybrid review (structural + AI semantic)           | AI-authored runtime chat replies    |

See [PRODUCT.md](./PRODUCT.md) for full details and rationale.

## Design Principles

### Product & architecture

1. **Design-time AI only.** Generate / explain / review use the LLM. Simulation is deterministic.
2. **Hybrid review.** Code catches structural defects; the LLM catches semantic ones. Findings merge with severity.
3. **Single source of truth.** One flow drives the graph, the structured view, and the executor.
4. **Shared schema.** One Zod type for backend, frontend, and LLM output.

### Engineering

5. **SOLID.** Modules depend on interfaces (`LLMProvider`), not vendor SDKs.
6. **Unified configuration.** All tunables in one env-driven layer; no scattered constants.
7. **Minimise external calls.** Stored flows are reused across endpoints; retry is bounded.
8. **Defence in depth.** Validate inputs, constrain LLM outputs, keep secrets server-only, log metadata not content. See [.cursor/rules/security.mdc](./.cursor/rules/security.mdc).

## Design Decisions

| Decision                                               | Rationale                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript monorepo (over Python or polyglot)          | Shared Flow types and Zod schema across server + web + validation                 |
| In-memory storage only                                 | MVP is single-session; persistence is out of scope                                |
| `LLMProvider` interface; DeepSeek as the default       | Swap models without changing agent code; provider chosen via env                  |
| Read-only React Flow graph (no editing canvas)         | Operators describe intent in prompts; flow changes happen by regeneration         |
| Deterministic FSM executor (not LLM-driven simulation) | Reproducible mock chat; review and demo behavior are predictable                  |
| Hybrid review (rules + LLM)                            | Structural rules cannot be hallucinated; the model adds judgment, not correctness |

Three workspace packages plus shared docs. Scaffold is runnable; business logic (agents, executor, validator, flow graph) lands incrementally on top.

## Architecture

### Module overview

```mermaid

    subgraph web [packages/web]
        ui[Three-panel UI]
    end

    subgraph server [packages/server]
        routes[HTTP routes]

        llm[LLMProvider]
    end

    subgraph shared [packages/shared]
        schema[Zod schema and types]
    end

    ui -->|REST| routes
    routes --> flowAgent
    routes --> reviewAgent
    routes --> executor
    routes --> store
    flowAgent --> llm
    reviewAgent --> llm

    flowAgent -.-> schema
    reviewAgent -.-> schema
    executor -.-> schema
    validator -.-> schema
    llm --> llmExt[LLM provider API]
```

Three packages share one Flow schema. Agents and the executor depend on the schema; the executor never imports the LLM layer.

### Runtime flows

- **Generate** — `FlowAgent` calls the `LLMProvider`, validates the response against the Zod schema (one retry on failure), and stores the flow.
- **Explain & review** — both load the stored flow. `explain` is LLM-only. `review` runs the structural validator and the `ReviewAgent` in parallel and merges findings by severity.
- **Simulate** — the deterministic FSM executor walks the flow; the LLM is never called during a step.

See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the full sequence diagrams.

## Data Model & API

Two resources: **Flow** (the generated automation, with nodes and edges) and **Simulation** (a session walking through a flow). Review findings come back as typed issues with severity.

See [docs/data-model.md](./docs/data-model.md) for entity fields, REST endpoints, request/response examples, status codes, and the shared error shape.

---

## Configuration

All settings come from environment variables, parsed once at boot by a single typed `config` module in `packages/server`. The process fails fast on missing required values; nothing else in the code reads `process.env` directly (see Design Principle 6).

| Variable               | Default                 | Required                                                | Description                                                              |

| `LLM_MODEL`            | `deepseek-chat`         | no                                                      | Model id passed to the provider                                          |
| `LLM_API_KEY`          | —                       | **yes** (unless `NODE_ENV=test` or `LLM_PROVIDER=mock`) | Provider API key. **Secret — server-only, never exposed to the browser** |
| `LLM_BASE_URL`         | provider default        | no                                                      | Override endpoint (self-hosted, proxy)                                   |
| `LLM_TIMEOUT_MS`       | `30000`                 | no                                                      | Per-request timeout for the provider                                     |
| `LLM_MAX_RETRY`        | `1`                     | no                                                      | Retries when LLM output fails Zod schema parsing                         |
| `SIMULATION_MAX_RETRY` | `2`                     | no                                                      | Question re-asks in mock chat before falling back                        |
| `PORT`                 | `3000`                  | no                                                      | Fastify HTTP port                                                        |
| `LOG_LEVEL`            | `info`                  | no                                                      | Pino log level (`trace` … `error`)                                       |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`          | `http://localhost:5173` | no                                                      | Allowed SPA origin                                                       |

A reference `.env.example` lives at `packages/server/.env.example`. Secret handling and logging hygiene follow [.cursor/rules/security.mdc](./.cursor/rules/security.mdc) — never log API keys, prompts, or user transcripts; log metadata only.
