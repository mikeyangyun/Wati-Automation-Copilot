# Wati Automation Builder Copilot

> AI-assisted design and pre-launch validation for Wati chatbot automations.

---

## Status

**Implementation complete.** All product surfaces are implemented end-to-end and covered by 563 automated tests (73 shared / 225 server / 265 web). For the take-home submission summary — what was built, the architecture decisions, and the demo video — see [WRITEUP.md](./WRITEUP.md).

- **Generate** — `FlowAgent` turns a natural-language prompt into a Zod-validated `Flow`. Recent prompts are persisted in `localStorage` for one-click reuse; **⌘+Enter** (or Ctrl+Enter) submits.
- **Mock simulation** — deterministic FSM executor with branch matching, retries, fallback, handoff, and reset. Surfaced through an explicit **Test Chatbot** button that opens a floating, drag-to-resize chat widget.
- **Explain** — markdown-rendered summary of how a flow behaves.
- **Hybrid review** — structural rules + semantic LLM analysis, merged by severity, with graceful degradation when the LLM is unavailable. Click an issue card to highlight the affected nodes on the graph.
- **Read-only graph** — auto-laid-out React Flow rendering with `Graph` / `JSON` toggle. Wati-style node cards (colored header, type-specific body preview, condition labels on edges) and issue → node highlight on click. Edge labels are staggered vertically per source (22 px step, capped band so labels never spill across ranks) so they never pile up on wide branching flows; long labels truncate with ellipsis + hover tooltip; fallback edges render dashed for at-a-glance visual hierarchy.
- **Workflow stepper** — three-step indicator (**Describe → Flow → Test**) in the app header advances as the user progresses, replacing per-panel step labels.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- Node `>=20` (project pins Node 22 LTS via `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm `>=9` (project pins `pnpm@11.1.2` via `packageManager`)

**Install and run**

```bash
nvm use                                                # reads .nvmrc
pnpm install
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env   # see below for LLM config
pnpm dev                                               # server on :3000, web on :5173
```

**LLM configuration**

The default `.env.example` ships with `LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek`. Pick one of:

- **Use the mock provider** (no API key, deterministic, recommended for first run): set `LLM_PROVIDER=mock` in `packages/server/.env`. Generate / Explain / Review will return canned responses.
- **Use a real DeepSeek key**: set `LLM_API_KEY=sk-...` in `packages/server/.env`.

**Verify**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# -> { "status": "ok", "uptime": ..., "timestamp": "..." }
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The UI is a header (title + three-step **Describe → Flow → Test** stepper) over a two-panel layout, with a chat widget that floats over the flow panel on demand:

- **Left — Prompt panel.** Textarea with starter examples, a **Generate** button (also fires on ⌘+Enter / Ctrl+Enter), a one-click **Recent** list backed by `localStorage`, and a soft character-count warning.
- **Right — Flow panel.** Generated flow rendered as an auto-laid-out, read-only graph with Wati-style node cards (default view; toggle to JSON). Header surfaces **Explain**, **Review**, **View JSON**, and **Test Chatbot** buttons. Before the first Generate, the panel shows an **Example preview** — a canonical buyer/seller routing flow rendered through the same graph component, with a dashed-border treatment so it's clearly a teaching aid.
- **Floating chat widget** (over the Flow panel). Opens only after **Test Chatbot** is clicked, persists across closes for the lifetime of the flow, and can be dragged to resize from its top-left grip (size persisted in `localStorage`).

## Overview

**Wati Automation Builder Copilot** lets operators describe a chatbot automation in plain English and turns it into a Wati-compatible flow. The system explains the resulting logic, reviews it for defects and gaps, and runs a deterministic mock conversation so the design can be walked through before any flow is published.

The Copilot sits **upstream of publish** — design and validate first, then configure the approved flow in the Wati Builder.

**Primary users:** customer operations and CS leads, plus small business owners configuring routing and FAQ bots.

## Scope

| In scope (MVP)                                     | Out of scope (MVP)                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Natural-language input with starter examples       | Drag-and-drop visual editor         |
| Generation of a Wati-style flow from a brief       | Publish or deploy to live channels  |

## Design Principles

### Product & architecture

1. **Design-time AI only.** Generate / explain / review use the LLM. Simulation is deterministic.
2. **Hybrid review.** Code catches structural defects; the LLM catches semantic ones. Findings merge with severity.
3. **Single source of truth.** One flow drives the graph, the structured view, and the executor.
4. **Shared schema.** One Zod type for backend, frontend, and LLM output.

### Engineering

5. **SOLID.** Modules depend on interfaces (`LLMProvider`), not vendor SDKs.
6. **Unified configuration.** All tunables in one env-driven layer; no scattered constants.
7. **Minimise external calls.** Stored flows are reused across endpoints; retry is bounded.
8. **Defence in depth.** Validate inputs, constrain LLM outputs, keep secrets server-only, log metadata not content. See [.cursor/rules/security.mdc](./.cursor/rules/security.mdc).

## Design Decisions

| Decision                                               | Rationale                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript monorepo (over Python or polyglot)          | Shared Flow types and Zod schema across server + web + validation                 |
| In-memory storage only                                 | MVP is single-session; persistence is out of scope                                |
| `LLMProvider` interface; DeepSeek as the default       | Swap models without changing agent code; provider chosen via env                  |
| Read-only React Flow graph (no editing canvas)         | Operators describe intent in prompts; flow changes happen by regeneration         |
| Deterministic FSM executor (not LLM-driven simulation) | Reproducible mock chat; review and demo behavior are predictable                  |
| Hybrid review (rules + LLM)                            | Structural rules cannot be hallucinated; the model adds judgment, not correctness |

Three workspace packages share one Zod schema. The `graph/` subtree in `web` and `validator/` + `executor/` subtrees in `server` are LLM-free by design — enforced via ESLint `no-restricted-imports`.

## Architecture

    flowAgent -.-> schema
    reviewAgent -.-> schema
    executor -.-> schema
    validator -.-> schema
    llm --> llmExt[LLM provider API]
```

Three packages share one Flow schema. Agents and the executor depend on the schema; the executor never imports the LLM layer.

### Runtime flows

- **Generate** — `FlowAgent` calls the `LLMProvider`, validates the response against the Zod schema (one retry on failure), and stores the flow.
- **Explain & review** — both load the stored flow. `explain` is LLM-only. `review` runs the structural validator and the `ReviewAgent` in parallel and merges findings by severity.
- **Simulate** — the deterministic FSM executor walks the flow; the LLM is never called during a step.

See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the full sequence diagrams.

---

## Data Model & API

Two resources: **Flow** (the generated automation, with nodes and edges) and **Simulation** (a session walking through a flow). Review findings come back as typed issues with severity.

See [docs/data-model.md](./docs/data-model.md) for entity fields, REST endpoints, request/response examples, status codes, and the shared error shape.

---

## Known Limitations

Scope cuts that were deliberate, not oversights:

- **In-memory storage with no eviction.** Generated flows and simulation sessions live in process RAM; they are lost on restart and accumulate over the process lifetime. Persistence and TTL are V2 work.
- **No rate limiting or authentication.** All API routes are public on the listening port. Acceptable for the local-only MVP; add `@fastify/rate-limit` and an auth layer before exposing the server.
- **No per-session step lock.** Two parallel `POST /step` calls on the same `sessionId` race; the loser's message is overwritten. Real deployments would need a per-session async mutex.
- **`@xyflow/react` graph is read-only.** Editing happens by regenerating from a refined prompt, not by direct manipulation. Permanent product choice, not a limitation of the renderer.

---

## Configuration

All settings come from environment variables, parsed once at boot by a single typed `config` module in `packages/server`. The process fails fast on missing required values; nothing else in the code reads `process.env` directly (see Design Principle 6).

A reference `.env.example` lives at `packages/server/.env.example`. Secret handling and logging hygiene follow [.cursor/rules/security.mdc](./.cursor/rules/security.mdc) — never log API keys, prompts, or user transcripts; log metadata only.
